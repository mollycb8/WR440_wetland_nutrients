Data was collected from three locations along the Delaware River, labeled as “before in” and “after.” The data covers the period from October 2017 to September 2020 to account for the 2018, 2019, and 2020 water years. The collected data was analyzed to assess the impact of freshwater/forested shrub wetlands on nitrogen levels in the Delaware River. The results showed that there was a significant change in nitrate concentrations between the before and after positions as well as the before and in positions. There was no significant change between the in and after positions for nitrate. Nitrite concentrations experienced no significant changes throughout all the positions. Furthermore, there was no correlation between nitrate or nitrate and the other environmental factors of dissolved oxygen, pH, and temperature. "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 2 Introduction", " Chapter 2 Introduction Nitrite and nitrate are two forms of nitrogen that can be found in freshwater systems and are indicators of nutrient pollution. The Delaware River is an important source of drinking water for millions of people, is an area for recreation, and provides a habitat for a variety of aquatic species. However, increasing levels of nitrate and nitrite concentrations in the river have raised concerns about the possible negative impacts the excessive levels can have on the water quality. In some locations within the Delaware River, nitrate and nitrite levels have exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s recommendations. (Delaware River Basin Commission, 2017). However, wetlands along the Delaware River could play a key role in removing nitrates and nitrites from the water. Wetlands have been shown to have the ability to remove soluble nitrogen from the water in ways that are difficult to reproduce through man-made materials. Wetlands can remove nitrates and nitrites from the water through the denitrification process. Denitrification is the microbial removal of nitrates and nitrites into nitrogen and nitrous oxide (Skiba, 2008). Wetlands are rich in microbial diversity and the wetlands along the Delaware River provide a habitat for these microbial species involved in denitrification (Seo et al., 2015). Furthermore, plants that grow within the wetlands can uptake nitrate and nitrite to use for their growth in development. The presence of these plants helps with decreasing the concentration of the two nutrients (Nilsson et al., 2020). But the removal of nitrates and nitrites is also influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen concentrations in the water. Temperature conditions of the water can either increase or decrease the denitrification process thus resulting in higher or lower concentrations of nitrates and nitrites. Furthermore, higher temperatures have been shown to increase the rate of production for nitrates and nitrites resulting in higher concentrations during the summer months. Furthermore, in these months with higher temperatures, the solubility of gases leads to higher concentrations of nitrate and nitrite. Higher temperatures have also been associated with an increase in the nitrification process. The nitrification process involves bacteria converting ammonia into nitrite and then into nitrite (Liu et al., 2014). Therefore, an increase in this process would also lead to an increase in nitrate and nitrite concentrations. pH can also have an impact on nitrate and nitrite concentrations in water. Highly acidic conditions can lead to an increase in nitrate and nitrite concentrations while basic conditions tend to decrease these concentrations. However, some studies have shown that nitrate reduction may be more susceptible to change based on the pH conditions (Woltemade &amp; Woodward, 2008). It can be noted though that pH only seems to have a very small influence on nitrate and nitrite removal through wetlands. Lastly, dissolved oxygen can play a key role in the nitrate and nitrite concentrations of water. Dissolved oxygen concentrations that are too low would lead to anoxic conditions. These low dissolved oxygen conditions allow for the denitrification process to occur which in turn would decrease the concentration of nitrate and nitrites in the water (Li et al., 2014). Soils found in wetlands are typically full of carbon and are anoxic. This provides the conditions necessary to remove nitrate and nitrite from the water (Cheng et al., 2020). Therefore, it is necessary to investigate dissolved oxygen levels to see how the nitrogen cycle happens in wetlands. Furthermore, it can show if the wetlands are active in the nutrient removal process or if it is a result of dissolved oxygen.

The data sources included STORET, USGS, NWIS, and STEWARDS. The time for data collection was from October 2017 to September 2020, which covered the 2018, 2019, and 2020 water years. The data collected was used to analyze the impact of dissolved oxygen, pH, and temperature on nitrate and nitrite levels in wetlands. Furthermore, the location for this data was chosen by finding a wetland area mapped on the National Wetlands Inventory Wetlands Mapper. Multiple monitoring locations were selected and then merged into three resulting location parameters labeled “before”, “in”, and “after”. The “before” location means the monitoring locations appears before the major wetland area. The before locations can be found using the monitoring location identifiers “21PA_WQX-WQN0101” and “USGS-01463500”. The “in” location includes the monitoring location that is within the wetland area. The in location can be found using the monitoring location identifier “31DELRBC_WQX-332068”. Lastly, the final location, labeled “after” is downstream of the wetland area. The after location can be found using the monitoring location identifier “31DELRBC_WQX-332064”. The map below shows where the monitoring locations are on the Delaware River.

From there, monthly average were created for each nutrient and environmental factor based on the location. To analyze the variation in nitrate and nitrite concentrations by position, water year, and season, a bar graph was generated using the ggplot2 package in R. To determine the correlations between different water parameters, a correlation heat map was generated using the ggplot package in R. The graph showed the correlation coefficients between nitrate, nitrite, DO, temperature, and pH. An ANOVA test was conducted to analyze the variation in nitrate and nitrite concentrations by year. The nitrate and nitrite concentrations were analyzed using the aov function in R. The significance level was set at p &lt; 0.05. Post-hoc tests (Tukey HSD) were conducted to determine significant differences between individual positions. Furthermore, the percent change between the locations was found and graphed using the ggplot package in R studio.

When looking at the seasons, there is not one that stands out as having the highest nitrate concentrations overall between all the water years. In the 2018 water year, average nitrate concentrations were the highest in the winter and spring months. In the 2019 water year, average nitrate concentrations were the highest in August specifically and the second highest in September. In the 2020 water year, the highest average nitrate concentrations were found in September. The highest average nitrate concentration reported for the before position was in September of the 2019 water year with a value of 5.76 mg/L . The highest reported value of nitrate in the in position was 4.46 mg/L in September of 2019. For the after position, the highest average value was in October 2019 at 1.68 mg/L.

It was found that generally in the fall, nitrite concentrations were the highest. The highest average nitrite concentration was 0.077 mg/L and it occurred at the in position in September of 2019. Overall, the month of September held the highest average nitrite concentration. The lowest concentration in nitrite occurred in October of 2018 in the before position at only 0.001 mg/L.

The percent change could not be plotted for before in themonth of January since there is no previous reference. The largest percent change that occurs for nitrate is for the before position. The percent change for before represents the change from the after site to the before site. The large increase in percent change shows that the before positions have higher nitrate levels than the after. The lowest percent changes occurs for the in position which represents the change between the before and in position. Since this is a negative value it shows that as water travels from the before wetlands position to the in wetlands position, nitrate levels will decrease. There was a very small percent change that occurred between the in and after sites, and it varied between positive and negative values. custom_order &lt;- c(&#39;Sep&#39;,&quot;Oct&quot;, &quot;Nov&quot;, &quot;Dec&quot;, &quot;Jan&quot;, &quot;Feb&quot;, &quot;Mar&quot;, &quot;Apr&quot;, &quot;May&quot;, &quot;Jun&quot;, &quot;Jul&quot;, &quot;Aug&quot;) pc$month &lt;- factor(pc$month, levels = custom_order) ggplot(pc, aes(x = month, y = pcrite, fill = position)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;dodge&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Percent Change of Nitrite based on position in the Delaware River&quot;, x = &quot;Month&quot;, y = &quot;Percent Change&quot;) + facet_grid(water_year~ factor(season, levels = c(&quot;Fall&quot;, &quot;Winter&quot;, &quot;Spring&quot;, &quot;Summer&quot;)), scales=&quot;free&quot;, space=&quot;free_x&quot;, ) Figure 5.

The percent change could not be plotted for before in themonth of January since there is no previous reference. The percent change in nitrite is quite variable with no recognizable patterns. The highest percent change was 500% for before in September of 2018. The lowest however, was in October of 2019 with -93%. 4.4 ANOVA for Nitrate There was a statistically significant change in nitrate concentrations as water moved through the wetlands. Specifically, the change between the before and after positions as well as the change in the before and in positions were statistically significant. However, there was no significant change in nitrate concentrations between the in and after positions. This would support the idea that as water travels through wetlands, nitrate levels would decrease. Thus meaning that wetlands act as a source for nitrate removal and can help improve water quality. nitrate_new &lt;- Total_Data_new %&gt;% filter(Nutrient == &#39;Nitrate&#39;) model &lt;- aov(Result ~ position, data = nitrate_new) summary(model) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## position 2 51.8 25.90 17.62 9.1e-08 *** ## Residuals 197 289.5 1.47 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 TukeyHSD(model) ## Tukey multiple comparisons of means ## 95% family-wise confidence level ## ## Fit: aov(formula = Result ~ position, data = nitrate_new) ## ## $position ## diff lwr upr p adj ## before-after 1.0843685 0.5611636 1.6075734 0.0000061 ## in-after 0.1174873 -0.4913284 0.7263030 0.8919127 ## in-before -0.9668812 -1.4614422 -0.4723202 0.0000209 4.5 ANOVA for Nitrite Through the ANOVA test that was run for nitrite concentrations based on positions, it was found that there is no significant change as water travels through the wetlands. This would mean that wetlands in the Delaware River do not play a significant role in the removal of nitrites. Nitrite concentrations were quite variable throughout the seasons and water year. Due to this, there is a greater chance that the avergae value would be 0 depending on position as all water years and seasons were taken into account. To if it was possible that this could be an issue three more anova tests were created looking at each individual water year. nitrite_new &lt;- Total_Data_new %&gt;% filter(Nutrient == &#39;Nitrite&#39;) model_rite &lt;- aov(Result ~ position, data = nitrite_new) summary(model) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## position 2 51.8 25.90 17.62 9.1e-08 *** ## Residuals 197 289.5 1.47 ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 TukeyHSD(model_rite) ## Tukey multiple comparisons of means ## 95% family-wise confidence level ## ## Fit: aov(formula = Result ~ position, data = nitrite_new) ## ## $position ## diff lwr upr p adj ## before-after -0.001249318 -0.006102545 0.003603909 0.8156268 ## in-after -0.003265372 -0.008740291 0.002209546 0.3379610 ## in-before -0.002016054 -0.006614103 0.002581995 0.5548463 nitrite_2018 &lt;- nitrite_new %&gt;% filter(water_year == &#39;2018&#39;) model_rite18 &lt;- aov(Result ~ position, data = nitrite_2018) summary(model_rite18) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## position 2 0.000115 5.753e-05 0.739 0.482 ## Residuals 57 0.004436 7.782e-05 TukeyHSD(model_rite18) ## Tukey multiple comparisons of means ## 95% family-wise confidence level ## ## Fit: aov(formula = Result ~ position, data = nitrite_2018) ## ## $position ## diff lwr upr p adj ## before-after -0.0005444169 -0.007559021 0.006470187 0.9809602 ## in-after -0.0034778846 -0.011404662 0.004448893 0.5451753 ## in-before -0.0029334677 -0.009468345 0.003601410 0.5301264 nitrite_2019 &lt;- nitrite_new %&gt;% filter(water_year == &#39;2019&#39;) model_rite19 &lt;- aov(Result ~ position, data = nitrite_2019) summary(model_rite19) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## position 2 0.000008 3.940e-06 0.025 0.976 ## Residuals 57 0.009092 1.595e-04 TukeyHSD(model_rite19) ## Tukey multiple comparisons of means ## 95% family-wise confidence level ## ## Fit: aov(formula = Result ~ position, data = nitrite_2019) ## ## $position ## diff lwr upr p adj ## before-after 0.0004785714 -0.009469371 0.010426514 0.9926395 ## in-after 0.0009936508 -0.009836297 0.011823598 0.9734969 ## in-before 0.0005150794 -0.008666455 0.009696614 0.9900047 nitrite_2020 &lt;- nitrite_new %&gt;% filter(water_year == &#39;2020&#39;) model_rite20 &lt;- aov(Result ~ position, data = nitrite_2020) summary(model_rite20) ## Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(&gt;F) ## position 2 0.000400 0.0002002 1.776 0.179 ## Residuals 52 0.005861 0.0001127 TukeyHSD(model_rite20) ## Tukey multiple comparisons of means ## 95% family-wise confidence level ## ## Fit: aov(formula = Result ~ position, data = nitrite_2020) ## ## $position ## diff lwr upr p adj ## before-after -0.003801061 -0.01235022 0.004748100 0.5351273 ## in-after -0.007846154 -0.01789261 0.002200301 0.1534218 ## in-before -0.004045093 -0.01259425 0.004504068 0.4932303 Even when looking at each water year on it’s own, the change in nitrite concentrations based position of the sample site was not statistically significant. 4.6 Dissolved Oxygen Dissolved oxygen concentrations were the highest in the winter and spring seasons.

Furthermore, there was no correlation between nitrite, dissolved oxygen, temperature of water, and pH. The highest correlation was found between dissolved oxygen and temperature at -0.93. The second strongest correlation was -0.42 between nitrite and DO. This could be considered as a moderate negative correlation between the two measurements. library(psych) library(reshape2) cols &lt;- c(&quot;Nitrate&quot;, &quot;Nitrite&quot;, &quot;DO&quot;, &quot;temp&quot;, &quot;pH&quot;) # compute the correlation matrix for the selected columns cor_df &lt;- round(cor(Total_Data[, cols], use = &quot;pairwise.complete.obs&quot;),2) melted_cor &lt;- melt(cor_df) ggplot(data = melted_cor, aes(x=Var1, y=Var2, fill=value)) + geom_tile() + geom_text(aes(Var2, Var1, label = value), size = 5) + scale_fill_gradient2(low = &quot;red&quot;, high = &quot;red4&quot;, limit = c(-1,1), name=&quot;Correlation&quot;) + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank(), panel.background = element_blank())+ labs(title = &quot;Correlation of measured parameters&quot;) Figure 9.

"],["discussion.html", "Chapter 5 Discussion 5.1 Wetland Removal 5.2 Environmental Factors 5.3 Correlations", " Chapter 5 Discussion 5.1 Wetland Removal There was a statistically significant change in nitrate concentrations as water moved through the wetland locations. The findings indicate that the wetland area can effectively reduce the amount of nitrate in the water passing through it, which is a significant finding given the negative impacts that nitrate pollution can have on aquatic ecosystems. Additionally, the lack of a statistically significant difference in nitrate concentrations between the “in” and “after” positions suggests that most of the nitrate removal occurs early on in the wetland rather than towards the end. Furthermore, the relatively similar values of nitrate concentration throughout all seasons could be attributed to the industrial area surrounding the wetlands. This area could be providing a steady input of nitrate into the water leading to lower variability in the data set. The percent change in nitrate concentrations from the after position to the before being consistently positive also helps to show that nitrate concentrations are higher before passing through wetlands. Furthermore, the percent change from before to in was consistently negative but the percent change from in to after was both positive and negative. This helps to further signify that nitrate removal occurs within the earlier parts of the wetlands. It could also show that there are other possible nitrate inputs that occur near the end of the wetland. This would cause the after positions to have higher nitrate values than them in positions. However, the fact that the nitrate concentrations are still lower in the after position than in the before shows that despite these potential inputs, the wetlands are still able to filter excess nutrients out of the water thus leading to cleaner waterways. The results of the study showed that nitrite concentrations did not exhibit a significant change based on the location with respect to the wetlands in the Delaware River. The percent change graph also helped to show that there was no significant change for nitrite as it was highly variable with no clear pattern being recognized. With the percent change graph, the highest and lowest percent changes occurred in the same season at different water years and in the same position. This further shows that the wetlands did not have an impact on the nitrite concentrations in the water. However, unlike nitrate, it was observed that nitrite concentrations were usually higher in the fall season. This would show that in the fall excess nitrites are being added to the water during this time. It is also consistent with previous studies that have shown that nitrite levels tend to increase in the fall due to decreased sunlight and reduced biological activity. More research would have to be done to see if there is a certain outside factor that is causing variable nitrite levels throughout the wetlands. 5.2 Environmental Factors There are other environmental impacts that could have impacted this data set. If this wetland is very high in organic material, it would make sense that the dissolved oxygen concentrations would be lower within and after the wetlands. The high amount of organic matter could lead to an increase in microbial activities that may deplete the oxygen supply. There was variability in temperature based on position, however, the data was not collected on the same day for each site. Because of this, it cannot be confirmed that wetlands have an impact on the temperature of water in this study. The average pH varied throughout the year and by location, however, the average pH for the Delaware River for all the water years was 7.3. This means that the water is usually not too acidic or basic. However, the pH of the water is more likely to become basic rather than acidic as the highest recorded value was 9.12 but the lowest was 6.3. The higher pH levels occurring in the summer months could be attributed to the increase in photosynthetic activity among the plants in the wetlands (Lowe et al., 2019). An increase in biological activity would lead to a decrease in pH which most likely occurs during the day in the summer. 5.3 Correlations Overall, there was very little correlation occurring between the different parameters studied. The strongest correlation coefficient was -0.92 between dissolved oxygen and temperature meaning that the two parameters may have an impact on one another. As temperature increases in the summer months dissolved oxygen would decrease and as temperature decreases in the winter, dissolved oxygen would increase. This coincides with previous research that has shown that as temperature increases, the solubility of oxygen decreases. This makes it harder for warmer waters to maintain dissolved oxygen concentrations. The second strongest correlation was between nitrite and dissolved oxygen. While the correlation coefficient was only -0.42 and therefore only considered to be of moderate correlation, some information can still be extracted. It could be possible that the amount of dissolved oxygen in the Delaware River could play a role in the concentration of nitrite. However, due to the small correlation coefficients found for the rest of the data, it cannot be confirmed that dissolved oxygen, temperature, and pH play a role in the nitrate/nitrite concentrations that occur within wetlands. Therefore, it is more likely that the wetlands are the main source of nitrate/nitrite removal. However, there are other factors that could be considered such as vegetation and sediments in the water that were not studied. Further research could help to show if other environmental factors have a higher correlation to nitrate and nitrite concentrations.
